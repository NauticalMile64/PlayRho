/// This test shows how a rope joint can be used to stabilize a chain of
/// bodies with a heavy payload. Notice that the rope joint just prevents
/// excessive stretching and has no other effect.
/// By disabling the rope joint you can see that the solver has trouble
/// supporting heavy bodies with light bodies. Try playing around with the
/// densities, time step, and iterations to see how they affect stability.
/// This test also shows how to use contact filtering. Filtering is configured
/// so that the payload does not collide with the chain.
