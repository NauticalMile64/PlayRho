# PlayRho

*A way to play with physical behaviors like the conservation of momentum.*

PlayRho is a real-time oriented physics engine and library that's currently best suited for
2-D games. The project name is the composition of the verb *play* with the noun *rho* where
*rho* is the Greek letter often used to represent physical quantities like momentum.

## Background

PlayRho started off as a port by Louis Langholtz of the Box2D 2.3.2 physics engine to "modern C++" (C++14). It's evolved into a derivative work by Louis and other contributors to the code base. Like its predecessor, PlayRho is also [licensed](LICENSE.txt) under a [Zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib).

General goals of this project are:
- Using and supporting newer features of the C++ language standards, particularly [C++14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14);
- Conforming to the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md),
  particularly in regards to things like avoiding global variables,
  preferring initialization, and preferring pure functions;
- Openness to contributions including pull requests with new features; and
- Providing a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
  backed, [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) supported,
  [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) validated, and [benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)) assessed, project.
