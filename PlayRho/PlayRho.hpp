@section intro_sec Getting Started

For source code, please see: https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho .

For issues, visit: https://github.com/louis-langholtz/PlayRho/issues .

For coding, simply begin by including the <code>PlayRho/PlayRho.hpp</code> file and
 make an instance of the
 <a href="classplayrho_1_1World.html"><code>playrho::d2::World</code></a> class.
For a more elaborate starting point, see the
 <a href="HelloWorld_8cpp-example.html"><code>HelloWorld.cpp</code></a> example application.

For mathemtical insight, see:
<a href="http://box2d.org/files/GDC2009/GDC2009_Catto_Erin_Solver.ppt">Erin Catto's
2009 Modeling and Solving Constraints slides</a>.
